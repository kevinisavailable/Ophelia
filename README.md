Never forget your passwords anymore. Lock it with your biometric

This was done for appwrite hackathon. 
To run this project :
0. Create an Appwrite Account
1. Create a new project (get the project id)
2. Create a database and then create two collections (one for storing users and other for storing passwords)
3. Create a bucket for storing users images
4. Store the id's to the environment variables. 
5. Run locally using npm run dev 
6. Enjoy Hacking...
